PSNLib...

This module is the last iteration/attempt to map the PSN API to a usable library.
There are two main submodules:
    RemotePlay – This module works with the PS API via user emulation (requires DartVision, cliclick).
    API – This module works directly with private playstation endpoints (requires a PSN account ids via os.environ).
